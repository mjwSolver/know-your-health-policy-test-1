This is not the official and final one. 

This is just to prove and test that the Github integration with Snowflake is still buggy.

**Basically move everything from the generated folder, out**.

Workaround:
1. Create a new `streamlit_app.py` outside of the generated folder from Snowflake.
2. Create a new `environment.yml` outside of the generated folder from Snowflake.
3. Then copy everything from each of those files.
